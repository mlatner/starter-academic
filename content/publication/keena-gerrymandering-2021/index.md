abstract: State legislatures are tasked with drawing state and federal districts and
  administering election law, among many other responsibilities. Yet state legislatures
  are themselves gerrymandered. This book examines how, why, and with what consequences,
  drawing on an original dataset of ninety-five state legislative maps from before
  and after 2011 redistricting. Identifying the institutional, political, and geographic
  determinants of gerrymandering, the authors find that Republican gerrymandering
  increased dramatically after the 2011 redistricting and bias was most extreme in
  states with racial segregation where Republicans drew the maps. This bias has had
  long-term consequences. For instance, states with the most extreme Republican gerrymandering
  were more likely to pass laws that restricted voting rights and undermined public
  health, and they were less likely to respond to COVID-19. The authors examine the
  implications for American democracy and for the balance of power between federal
  and state government; they also offer empirically grounded recommendations for reform.
