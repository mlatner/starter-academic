abstract: The case of Vieth v. Jubelirer (2004) challenges us to find a standard for
  partisan gerrymandering that is judicially discernable and manageable. Without such
  a standard even the most egregious partisan gerrymanders cannot be effectively challenged.
  However, we argue that the way to find a suitable standard is not to embark on a
  quest for a “new” standard. Rather it is to take the existing valid measures that
  science gives us, and show that these can be grounded in constitutionally protected
  rights. Using recent results in social choice theory, we show that the existing
  partisan symmetry standard can be derived from an individual right to equal protection.
  We also show that the existing technology for measuring partisan symmetry can provide
  a judicially manageable test for partisan bias.
