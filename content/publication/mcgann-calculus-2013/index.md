abstract: We present a theory of comparative political institutions based on the concept
  of consensus democracy and social choice theory. Unlike Lijphart, we argue that
  “consensus democracy” is not a special form of democracy characterized by mutual
  vetoes, but rather the simplest form of democracy, which we refer to as PR-majority
  rule. We construct a typology of political institutions based on differences with
  this simple model. Contra Tsebelis’s veto players approach, our theory predicts
  that PR-majority rule should be the most flexible form of democracy. We test this
  with data on overall patterns of government spending and on welfare state reform.
