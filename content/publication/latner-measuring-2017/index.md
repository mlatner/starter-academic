abstract: The Digital Democracy platform developed at California Polytechnic State
  University, www.digitaldemocracy.org, is an open government platform that features
  a searchable database of California state legislative committee hearings and floor
  sessions, allowing the user to search content by keyword, topic, speaker or date.
  In this research note, we introduce the platform, summarize several measures of
  behavioral data, and encourage public feedback on what types of interactive features
  might be built into the platform in the near future. Using the 2015-2016 legislative
  session as our sample (the first complete legislative session for which data was
  collected), we review basic features of the platform before exploring the participation
  of parties, party members and citizens. We conclude with a reflection on the potential
  for this technology to enhance citizen oversight and accountability in the legislative
  process.
