abstract: It has frequently been argued that proportional representation leads to
  national politics with little or no regional representation. We examine this in
  the case of the two most extreme cases of proportional representation, Israel and
  the Netherlands. We find that actually there are very distinct patterns of geographical
  representation. Although central metropolitan areas are somewhat over-represented
  in the legislatures, so are the most peripheral regions. This is due to the fact
  that parties tend to choose representatives from the geographical regions where
  they expect to be electorally competitive. Furthermore, proportional representation
  does not necessarily lead to nationally competitive parties, as in Israel. We also
  consider the relationship between geographical and other aspects of descriptive
  representation, such as gender and ethnicity.
