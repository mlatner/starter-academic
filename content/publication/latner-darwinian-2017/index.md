abstract: I develop a theory of political organization grounded in the algorithmic
  logic of Darwinian selection. Modern political systems sustain large-scale cooperation
  and reduce parasitism through the generation of institutions that select for favorable
  policy strategies and their associated behavioral traits. Competition over what
  traits should be favored requires institutions that explore variation in traits
  or strategies, while exploiting the value of existing traits that yield cooperative
  benefits. These insights are translated into three principles of political organization,
  principles that place constitutional democracy atop a series of major transitions
  in the evolution of cooperation.
